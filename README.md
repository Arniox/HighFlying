<p><b>Our Product Pitch Proposal:</b><br>
High Flying is the next greatest android game that'll blow your socks off. It's a wing suiting, sci-fi crazy adventure where you wingsuit across beautiful valleys of alien forests, lakes of lava, rivers of molten diamond, and other amazing alien landscapes.

This is a wing suiting adventure you won't want to miss. It's going to be developed for the android mobile phones and will be using accelerometer for controls.</p>

<p><b>How far we got with that:</b><br>
We're going to be honest, we didn't get all the things into the game that we originally proposed so long ago. The task of learning Unity and then putting that knowledge to actual use was extremely difficult, but through all that, we managed to create a working product that displays an immense amount of learning, team work and tears.
I think we even said during the conceptualising phase: "This is going to be easy. All we need is a few classes, maybe about 8 or 9 and we're done"... Good god where we wrong.
The one thing that stuck very true through most of the entire project was our very original UI design. The game follows almost the exact same design we built on August the 16th.</p>

<p><b>Our Selected Archetype Design Pattern:<br></b>
MVC was chosen for this project based on how Unity is pre-built around the idea of MVC. The models are the physical objects within the world, the view is the UI of the game and the control is all the scripting behind the game.</p>

<p><b>Sprint 1 - Planning:<br></b>
To create the Product Backlog we had to determine the functionality that we wanted to include
in our game. To do this we created a few diagrams that outlined the functionality that we
wanted to include and described how each piece of functionality was related.

The writing and INVEST analysis of each user story was divided equally among all team
members. We played planning poker to assign each user story points based on how hard we
though each user story would be to implement.

To create the Sprint 1 Backlog our product owner (Nikkolas) created a list of the user stories
that he thought were the most important. We then discussed this list as a team and moved the
agreed user stories to the Sprint 1 Backlog. The list that Nikkolas created is included below:
<ul>
    <li>As a player, I want the game to have a consistent art style so each world in the game
    looks consistent</li>
    <li>As a player, I want the game to end when I have zero lives so that the game will be more
    challenging</li>
    <li>As a player, I want to have a life system in the game so that the game has more
    challenge</li>
    <li>As a player, I want to be able to crash into obstacles during each level so that the game
    is more challenging</li>
    <li>As a player, I want the game to be resizable based on the device resolution so that I can
    play it on different devices</li>
    <li>As a player, I want there to be rings in the game, so that they can be flown through
    during gameplay to gain more coins or other rewards</li>
    <li>As a player I want to be able play the game using a humanoid character dressed in a
    wing-suit so that I am able to relate better to the game.</li>
    <li>As a player, I want to be able to move left and right with my controls to be able to control
    the character and play the game</li>
    <li>As a player I want to be able to play the game in multiple different worlds so that I don't
    get bored with the scenery in the game.</li>
    <li>As a player, I want to be able to dive off a high point and wing suit down to a low point so
    that the game is more realistic</li>
    <li>As a player, I want my character to be able to fly with a wingsuit, so that I can move my
    character and collect coins and rings in the game</li>
</ul>
